# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Logistic-Regression

This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset to build and compare machine learning models for predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation heatmaps, histograms, and boxplots to understand feature distributions.

Model Training:

Random Forest Classifier (primary model)

Logistic Regression (for comparison)

Model Evaluation:

Random Forest:

Accuracy: ~97%

F1 Score: ~0.97

Logistic Regression:

Accuracy: ~95%

F1 Score: ~0.95

Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve

Model Saving: Trained Random Forest model saved as .pkl for easy reuse.

Why this project?
This notebook serves as a practical example of how to:

Prepare medical datasets for machine learning

Compare different classification algorithms

Save and reuse trained models for real-world predictions

How to Use:

Clone the repository.

Open the .ipynb notebook in Jupyter/Colab.

Run all cells to train and evaluate the models.

Use the saved .pkl model for new predictions.

Dataset:
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and sklearnâ€™s datasets module.
